# Digit_Recognition
This is a collection of three code files which uses Multi-layer perceptron model and in latter the addition of CNN layers to recognize the digits from MNIST dataset.

Keras automatically downloads the dataset if you don't have it on your system.

The file "code.py" is a simple demonstration of Digit recognition using Multi-Layer Perceptron Model.
While the files "code2.py" uses a basic CNN layer along with Pooling layers.
And finally "code3.py" uses larger CNN layers.
